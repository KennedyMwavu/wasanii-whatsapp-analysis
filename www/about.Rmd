### Who?
Wasanii is a WhatsApp group of 5 friends (& classmates, FWIW), formed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Why?
The major reason the group was formed was to combat boredom. The whole country was on lockdown and we couldn't meet as we'd have liked to. It's where we'd organize our online games & also plan on how to go about a certain game if we were playing against another team. Not your typical games though. Most of them were actually math games. We love math.

### Why the name Wasanii?
Even though we're all lovers of math & major in the same faculty, we also have very different interests & passions. Wasanii is a swahili word that translates to `artists` in english and we take it to mean more of a designer or mastery in a certain field.
